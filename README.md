# Python , Object Oriented Programming

This is a guide to learning object oriented programming in python

# The principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) include:

**Encapsulation:** This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as an object. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access through well-defined interfaces.

**Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem and hiding unnecessary details from the user. It allows programmers to focus on the relevant parts of the object's behavior.

**Inheritance:** Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes.

**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent general classes to operate on objects of various types.

These principles aid in creating **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable code** in OOP languages like Java, C++, Python, and others.
